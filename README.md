# MachineLearningMCMC

Very simple tool for predicting likelihoods from Markov Chains Using ML tools. Currently only accepts chains where all variables are saved within a ROOT TTree. 

# Configs
Configs are in YAML format

```yaml
FileSettings:
    FileName : "/path/to/file"  #Â Name of File
    ChainName : "/tree/name"    # Name of Tree in file containing chain

    # Names of parameters to fit, finds all parameters containing names in this string as sub-string
    ParameterNames : ["sin2th", "sin2th","delm2_12", "delta", "xsec"]

    # Name of variable you're fitting in
    LabelName : "LogL"
    
    # Parameters you don't want to include in the model
    IgnoredParameters : ["LogL_systematic_xsec_cov", "Log", "LogL_systematic_nddet_cov", ]

    # Any cuts, for MaCh3 I'd recommend capping LogL
    ParameterCuts : ["LogL<12345678", "step>10000"]

    # Do you want it to be verbose?
    Verbose:= false

    # Where is the model being pickled?
    ModelOutputName : "histboost_model_full.pkl"


FitterSettings:
    # Package model is included in
    FitterPackage : "SciKit" 

    # Fitter Name
    FitterName : "HistBoost"

    # Size of test set (range is 0-1)
    TestSize : 0.8
    # Set fitter Hyper Parameters, these are found in the fitter's readme
    FitterKwargs:
            # n_jobs = 32
            verbose: True
            max_iter: 10000
            # n_estimators = 200

```
# Executables
Simply run `python MachineLearningMCMC -c /path/to/toml/config` and it'll automatically run the chain. 

# Implementing a New Fitter
Implementing a new fitter is relatively simple. Most implementing is done in `machine_learining/ml_factory/MLFactory`. For Scikit-Learn based models, the new method just needs to imported and added to the `scikit` entry in `__IMPLEMENTED_ALGORITHMS`.

For non-scikit based algorithms currentlt no implementation exists. For such cases a new interface class (which inherits from `FMLInterface`) needs to be implemented. Hopefully in future this is easy to do!

# TODO:
* More libs than scikit
* Configurable fitters
* Clearer Readme
